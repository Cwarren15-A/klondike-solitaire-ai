```bash
# Quick deployment to see your game live
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Amazing Klondike Solitaire with AI"
git branch -M main
# Push to GitHub and enable Pages
```

### **Step 2: Enhance Current File (2-3 days)**
**Add these features to your existing HTML file:**

   - Puzzle mode (specific deals)
   - AI vs Player mode

### **Step 3: Real TensorFlow.js Integration (1 week)**
**Replace simulated AI with real neural networks:**

```javascript
// Add to your existing MLManager class
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

class RealNeuralNetwork {
  async initializeModel() {
    // Create a simple position evaluation network
    this.model = tf.sequential({
      layers: [
        tf.layers.dense({inputShape: [52], units: 128, activation: 'relu'}),
        tf.layers.dropout({rate: 0.2}),
        tf.layers.dense({units: 64, activation: 'relu'}),
        tf.layers.dense({units: 32, activation: 'relu'}),
        tf.layers.dense({units: 1, activation: 'sigmoid'}) // Win probability
      ]
    });
    
    this.model.compile({
      optimizer: 'adam',
      loss: 'binaryCrossentropy',
      metrics: ['accuracy']
    });
  }
  
  // Train on your recorded games
  async trainFromHistory(gameHistory) {
    const features = gameHistory.map(game => this.extractFeatures(game.state));
    const labels = gameHistory.map(game => game.won ? 1 : 0);
    
    await this.model.fit(
      tf.tensor2d(features),
      tf.tensor1d(labels),
      {epochs: 50, batchSize: 32}
    );
  }
}
```
