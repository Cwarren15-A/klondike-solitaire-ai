# 🧠 Graph Transformer + Polynormer Architecture Implementation

## 🚀 **Advanced AI Architecture for Klondike Solitaire**

This implementation introduces cutting-edge machine learning architectures to create the most sophisticated Solitaire AI ever built in JavaScript.

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Graph Transformer Layer**
- **Multi-Head Attention**: 8 attention heads with 32-dimensional head space
- **Graph Structure Understanding**: Models relationships between cards as graph nodes and edges
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Learns complex card-to-card dependencies
- **Residual Connections**: Stable training with skip connections
- **Layer Normalization**: Consistent feature scaling

### **Polynormer Layer**
- **Polynomial Feature Engineering**: Up to 3rd-degree polynomial transformations
- **Higher-Order Interactions**: Captures non-linear relationships between game features
- **Feature Combination**: Intelligent merging of polynomial features
- **Complexity Scoring**: Measures game state complexity

---

## 🧮 **Mathematical Foundation**

### **Graph Transformer Attention**
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V
```
Where:
- Q, K, V are query, key, value matrices for card features
- d_k = 32 (head dimension)
- Multi-head attention learns different types of card relationships

### **Polynomial Feature Transformation**
```
P(x) = Σ(i=1 to n) w_i × x^i
```
Where:
- x = input features (card positions, suits, values)
- w_i = learned weights for each polynomial degree
- n = polynomial degree (up to 3)

## 🕸️ **Graph Representation**

### **Node Features (128-dimensional)**
- **Card Identity**: One-hot encoding for each of 52 cards
- **Position Features**: Location in stock, waste, tableau, foundation
- **Card Properties**: Face-up state, value, suit, color
- **Strategic Features**: Accessibility, importance scores

### **Edge Types**
- `valid_move`: Direct move possibilities between cards
- `sequence`: Sequential card relationships (K-Q-J)
- `suit_match`: Same suit connections
- `color_alternate`: Red-black alternating patterns
- `strategic`: Complex strategic relationships

```typescript
// Generate polynomial features for non-linear patterns
for (let degree = 1; degree <= 3; degree++) {
  const polyFeature = Math.pow(inputFeature, degree);
  const transformed = this.polynomialWeights[degree-1].apply(polyFeature);
  polynomialFeatures.push(transformed);
